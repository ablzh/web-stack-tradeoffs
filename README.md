**This repo will contains an academic artifacts for the paper:** "Evaluating Programming Language Design Trade-offs: Expressiveness vs. Explicitness in the Ruby and Python Web Stacks".

## Motivation  
The primary goal is to conduct Comparative Research to objectively assess the pedagogical trade-offs between Ruby’s philosophy ("Developer Happiness,") and Python’s ("Explicit is better than implicit") within the context of teaching web architecture principles (MVC).

**Ruby**  
Rails: follows the “Convention over Configuration” philosophy, aiming for expressiveness and developer comfort.

**Python**  
Django: sticks to “Explicit is better than implicit,” focusing on clarity and structure.

The idea is to see how these contrasting philosophies influence how we write, read, and teach small educational web apps.

## Research Objective  
The study compares how language and framework design affect:
1. How easy it is to read and understand example code;
2. How expressive or verbose the syntax feels;
3. The mental effort and boilerplate involved in building a simple “To-Do List” web app for teaching.
